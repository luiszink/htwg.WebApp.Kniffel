            <h2>Welcome to the Kniffel Project</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Kniffel Project â€“ a modern take on the classic dice game! This project was developed as part of my studies in Applied Computer Science, with a focus on enhancing skills in <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>software engineering</strong>, and <strong>user interface design</strong>. Kniffel, also known as Yahtzee, is a game of luck and strategy where players aim to score the highest number of points by rolling five dice and matching specific combinations.</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This Kniffel game is built using <strong>Scala</strong> with the <strong>Play Framework</strong>, combining backend functionality with a clean and interactive frontend experience. One of the primary goals of this project was to integrate a terminal-based User Interface (TUI) into a web application, allowing users to play the game directly through their browser.</p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Classic Kniffel gameplay</strong> with familiar rules and score combinations.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Web UI</strong>: Powered by Scala's Play Framework to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay.</li>
                <li><strong>TUI Integration</strong>: The game offers a command-line style interface within the browser for users who enjoy a retro gaming experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring Automation</strong>: Automatic calculation of scores based on the combinations rolled, following the traditional rules of Kniffel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming Language</strong>: Scala</li>
                <li><strong>Framework</strong>: Play Framework</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI interactions)</li>
                <li><strong>Backend</strong>: RESTful APIs built using Play for handling game logic</li>
                <li><strong>Development Tools</strong>: SBT (Scala Build Tool), Metals for Scala, and Git for version control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
            <p>The Kniffel project is not just a fun game, but a learning experience in applying various software development principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Software Architecture</strong>: Design and development of a modular system where the backend game logic is decoupled from the frontend.</li>
                <li><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: Extensive use of <strong>JUnit</strong> for testing game logic and ensuring robust code quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Integration</strong>: Using Git and automated testing to ensure smooth project evolution and maintain code reliability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Future Plans</h2>
            <p>One of the challenges in this project was integrating the TUI within a modern web interface. Moving forward, I aim to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve the UI design and make it more visually appealing.</li>
                <li>Expand the game with multiplayer support, allowing users to compete against each other in real-time.</li>
                <li>Implement advanced features like saving and loading games, and leaderboards to track high scores.</li>
            </ul>
